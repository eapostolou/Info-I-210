## Assignment 1: Git Readme

### Websites vs Web Applications

A website is typically filled with information, while a webapp is typically something more interactive. For example, a wiki or a government website would classify as a website, while a game or social media would be more along the lines of a web app.

### VS Code & Extensions

VS Code is a source code editor used to code in several different languages. Extensions are different modifications to VS Code that allow for multiple different minor changes, such as prettier which changes how code shows up visually.

### Version Control, Git, & GitHub

Version Control is how you keep code organized across different devices, often with multiple contributors. Git and GitHub are the version control programs we use in this class.

### Markdown & Documentation

Markdown is a simple coding language, often used in web development. Documentation typically refers to how your code is organized, and the notes that you add into it.
